# Landing Page

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

#### This project is the first ever, full webpage that I have not only designed, but can be proud of! The purpose of this project was to incorperate the skills that I have learned in the last week, such as the use of html coding to format the body of my page and the use of multiple css elements. While looking through the code of this project, you will find the usage of different typography styles, examples of cascading, the usage of a float, multiple box models and links.

## Setup
* Clone this repository
* Open simple HTTP Server in the top level of the cloned directory forum

## Known Bugs
#### Anytime I center any text that is apart of a "ul" or "ol" list, the colons/numbers stay to the left of the screen. I have not been able to fix this problem yet.
