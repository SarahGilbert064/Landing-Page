  <h1><center>Hello! My name is Sarah and I can't wait to work with you!</center></h1>
  <h2><center>But first, a little bit about me....</center></h2>

  <div class="about">
    <p>Born in Arizona but raised in the foothills of the Rockies in Idaho, I grew up loving the outdoors and the adventure that comes with it. I graduated from Centennial High School in 2009 and quickly went off to college at Boise State University. I only spent a semester there, as I was young and not quite sure what I wanted to do with my life yet. I had many hobbies that I enjoyed, but one of my favorites was Scuba Diving, so after some research I packed my bags and moved to Honduras to get my PADI Scuba Instructor licence. All of the sudden I found myself, at just 19 years old, jetting around the world to teach scuba for different schools and resorts! This ended up being one of the best decisions I ever made as I gained knowledge and expereienc working with people of all ages, from all different countries and backgrounds, where I constantly helped others work through problems so they could reach their goals. </p>

    <p>After 4 years and over 10 countries, I found myself missing home and ready for the next adventure. I moved back to Boise in 2014 where I worked a number of different jobs over a few years before being offered a position to help start an indoor cannabis farm in Portland, Oregon. I assisted with the creation of the company for two years, which found me in a dark place. Being the only woman working for the company at the time, I struggled to find my place and felt ostracized for not being <em>"one of the boys"</em>. I longed to have more freedom with my career and wished to be in a position were I could let my creativity juices flow and be recognized for the hard work that I did.</p>

    <p> Jump to present day and you'll find me learning all things coding at Epicodus! I was introduced to this field by my partner, and after doing some heavy research I decided that the desk job I always feared might actually be the job that I always wanted. I look forward to learning new things daily, challenging myself, but especially those moments of overcoming problems and reaping the benifits of my hard work. I am so excited to become apart of this field and it's people. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me!</p>
