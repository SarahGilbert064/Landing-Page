    <h2><span class="header">But first, a little bit about me....</span></h2>

    <p>Born in Arizona but raised in the foothills of the Rockies in Idaho, I grew up loving the outdoors and the adventure that comes with it. I graduated from Centennial High School in 2009 and quickly went off to college at Boise State University. I only spent a semester there, as I was young and not quite sure what I wanted to do with my life yet. I had many hobbies that I enjoyed, but one of my favorites was Scuba Diving, so after some research I packed my bags and moved to Honduras to get my PADI Scuba Instructor licence. All of the sudden I found myself, at just 19 years old, jetting around the world to teach scuba for different schools and resorts! This ended up being one of the best decisions I ever made as I gained knowledge and expereienc working with people of all ages, from all different countries and backgrounds, where I constantly helped others work through problems so they could reach their goals. </p>
      <ul>A few places I've gotten to experience life in:
        <li>Thailand</li>
        <li>Mexio</li>
        <li>Cyprus</li> 
      </ul>

    <p>After 4 years and over 10 countries, I found myself missing home and ready for the next adventure. I moved back to Boise in 2014 where I worked a number of different jobs over a few years before being offered a position to help start an indoor cannabis farm in Portland, Oregon. I assisted with the creation of the company for two years, which found me in a dark place. Being the only woman working for the company at the time, I struggled to find my place and felt ostracized for not being <em>"one of the boys"</em>. I longed to have more freedom with my career and wished to be in a position were I could let my creativity juices flow and be recognized for the hard work that I did.</p>

    <p> <strong>Jump to present day and you'll find me learning all things coding at Epicodus!</strong> I was introduced to this field by my partner, and after doing some heavy research I decided that the desk job I always feared might actually be the job that I always wanted. I look forward to learning new things daily, challenging myself, but especially those moments of overcoming problems and reaping the benifits of my hard work. I am so excited to become apart of this field and it's people. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me!</p>

        <p>This was my first ever webpage! I was able to create a page talking a little bit about myself and some of my favorite animals...like the Sealion! I used html and css, all done using Visual Studio Code.</p>

        <p>On this project, I worked on a team with a fellow programmer. We created a page that showcased three travel packages to New Zealand, all with different offers and at different costs. We used html, css, and bootstrap. All code was built using Visual Studio Code.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/austinschrader/favorite-band" target="_blank">Favorite Band</a></p>

        <p>This was a team project done with 2 other programmers at Epicodus. We created a page about the iconic band Queen! In this project we used htlm, css, added images and built all of the code using Visual Studio Code.</p>
