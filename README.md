# Landing Page

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

#### This project is the first ever, full webpage that I have not only designed, but can be proud of! The purpose of this project was to incorperate the skills that I have learned in the last week, such as the use of html coding to format the body of my page and the use of multiple css elements. While looking through the code of this project, you will find the usage of different typography styles, examples of cascading, the usage of a float, multiple box models and links.
